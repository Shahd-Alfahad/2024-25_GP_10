 Introduction
 
CultureLens is a web-based app that assesses socio-cultural values and views in multilingual models. It helps users evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) and chat tools such as ChatGpt by providing a means to evaluate the multilingual language models through a robust dataset that reflects cultural norms and perspectives from diverse regions.
